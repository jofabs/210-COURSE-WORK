"""Question 4
Look back at last week's tasks.
Describe the run-time bounds of these algorithms using Big O notation."""


Task 1 is O(n):
    Because the loop continues until the items in the list are exhausted


Task 2 is O(log n):
    Because it is logarithmic in finding or counting the zeros of the given
    number
